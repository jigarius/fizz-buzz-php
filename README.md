A small, neat and clean command-line application to demonstrate PHP syntax to
people who've never seen PHP code before. It also demonstrates simple writing
simple tests with `phpunit`.

## What is Fizz Buzz?

**Fizz buzz** is a group word game for children to teach them about division.
Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by
three with the word *fizz*, and any number divisible by five with the word
*buzz*.

## Usage

* Clone the repository.
* Add exec permissions to the `fizzbuzz` file;
  `chmod +x ./fizzbuzz`.
